# Impact of Environmental Factors on Plant Growth

## Overview
This Jupyter Notebook analyzes the impact of various environmental factors on plant growth. It explores how variables such as temperature, humidity, soil moisture, and sunlight influence plant development.

## Dataset
The analysis is based on collected data, which includes:
- **Temperature** (Â°C)
- **Humidity** (%)
- **Soil Moisture** (%)
- **Sunlight Exposure** (hours/day)
- **Plant Growth Metrics** (height, leaf count, biomass, etc.)

## Requirements
To run this notebook, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

Additionally, Jupyter Notebook must be installed and accessible.

```bash
pip install notebook
```

## Usage
1. Clone the repository or download the notebook file.
2. Open the notebook in Jupyter:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Impact_of_Environmental_Factors_on_Plant_Growth.ipynb
   ```
3. Run the cells sequentially to analyze the data and visualize the results.

## Analysis and Insights
- The notebook contains data preprocessing steps, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization of relationships between environmental factors and plant growth.
- Statistical models and machine learning techniques may be applied to predict plant growth based on environmental conditions.

## Results
- Key findings are summarized in visualizations and tables.
- Insights can help in optimizing environmental conditions for improved plant health and yield.
